              For the past 13 weeks I have had the opportunity to work with the
              talented team at H.Essers. H.Essers is a transport and warehousing
              company that is focused on providing the best service to its
              customers. H.Essers has over 1.3 million square feet of storage
              and a fleet of over 1.400 trucks. You can imagine how many
              packages move through the warehouses every day.

            <p class="internship-content-text">
              My internship at H.Essers was a great experience. I learned a lot
              of new technical skills. Eventho I was working on a project that
              was a bit more complicated than I thought it would be, I learned a
              lot about the project management and how to work with a team. The
              project I worked on was a solo project, but we still kept to the
              agile methodology. We did a standup meeting every day and we held
              a sprint-review at the end of each sprint.
            </p>
            <p class="internship-content-text">
              Most of the communication was done through Microsoft Teams.
              Whenever I had a question, I could always reach out to the team.
              If there was a bigger issue or a lot of questions that needed to
              be addressed, I could always plan in a meeting with my
              internshipmentor. This could be an online meeting in Teams or a
              in-person meeting. For the in person meeting i had to reserve a
              meeting room.

            <h5>Assignment</h5>
            <p class="internship-content-text">
              As stated above, when there is over 1.3 million square feet of
              storage and a fleet of over 1.400 trucks there are a lot of moving
              packages. Currently H.Essers has a bit of a dated system for
              handling these movements. My task was to create a new system that
              modernizes the current workflow and allows for more efficient way
              of handling these packages. The technology I used was Java Spring
              Boot in the backend and Vaadin in the frontend.
            </p>
            <p class="internship-content-text">
              With such a big project, came a lot of responsibilities. It was a
              fullstack project, this means that I was in charge of the database
              setup in Docker. I decided to use a PostgreSQL database. For the
              database management, I used Liquibase. I was not familiar with it
              at all. After some research I was able to use it for database
              migration, so that would be used to migrate the database to the
              newest version. Aside from the database I also had to deal with
              the frontend. I used Vaadin to create the frontend. Vaadin was
              completely new to me and I was a bit confused at first, but after
              a slight learning period I was able to get started. Luckely I had
              some experience with Spring Boot, so the backend was a bit more
              familiar.

            <p class="internship-content-text">
              Essers focuses on the "clean code" and "best practices"
              principles. To assure them that they are putting out their best
              code to production they use Sonarqube. It was no different for my
              project. With the help of Sonarqube I was able to adjust my code
              and remove unwanted codesmells or security issues. Alongside
              Sonarqube I used pull requests. This gives my internship mentor
              the ability to review my code and make request changes if he so
              pleases. You can consider these pull requests as a first line of
              defense. It's a good way to make sure that obvious errors, like
              typos, are fixed before they are merged into the master branch.

              Sights In Sight is a project where we were tasked to create an AR
              app using Flutter. After some brainstorming we decided to create
              an application that allows you to see a 3d model of a sight on a
              map. All you had to do was to scan an image on the map and the app
              would detect the right building and show you the 3d sight. We had
              plenty of other features, if you're interested in them, check out
              the full article below.
